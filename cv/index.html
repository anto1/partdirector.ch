    <p>I am a fan of road cycling. Favorite places to ride — Versilia and the road around the Geneva Sea.</p>
    <p>As a designer from the 2010s, I, of course, used to collect rare vinyl records, but my entire collection burned down in a warehouse fire. Since then, Spotify has been enough for me.</p>
